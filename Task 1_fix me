print("Hello class, I hope you are having a great day. What is your name?") # Block 1 - here I salute the visitor
name=input() # Block 2, here I tell python that I want to create a variable that will store an input entered by the user

print("Hi " + name + " !!!!. I am happy to see you here!") # Block 3 - here I salute the visitor using his/her name stored in that variable

print("Did you know that I can do simple maths?..... my creator taught me how to maths like x*y."
      "\nPlease insert a number for x....") # Block 4 - here I tell the visitor that I can do maths and ask for a number for X

x= input() # Block 5 - here tell Python that I want to create a variable called x and that x is equal to an user input

print("Now, insert a number for the y variable please :)") # Block 6 - here I tell the visitor that I can do maths and ask for a number for y
y= input() # Block 7 - here tell Python that I want to create a variable called y and that y is equal to an user input

product = x * y # Block 8 creates a variable that multiplies variables X and Y

print("My neural network has calculated that the product of X and Y is equal to:" + str(product)) # Block 9 spits the result of the multiplication
