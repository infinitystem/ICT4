# This program will be used to calculate how much time you spend on a subject at school using simple mathematics.

# Addressing friend

name = input("Hello friend, what is your name")
print("Hi " + name + ", it's nice to meet you. My name is Nikhil Gaba.")

# Ask friend to name a subject

subject =  input("Name a subject:")

# Tell friend that he is going to know how long he does that subject for in a week

print ("I will tell you how much time you spend on " + subject + " per week." )

# Ask friend how many periods he does this subject for in a weekand how long is one period for in minutes

periods = int(input("How many periods do you have "+ subject + " for in a week?"))
time = int(input("How much time in minutes does a period go for?"))

# give friend answer in minutes

def multiply(periods, time):
    return periods*time

print(name,",you spend ",multiply(periods,time)," minutes on ",subject,"in a week.")
